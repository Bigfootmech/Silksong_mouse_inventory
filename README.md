<h1>Description:</h1>
I use mouse-and-keyboard to play pretty much all games.

Hollow Knight (and Silksong) is made for controller, with mouse-and-keyboard as an afterthough.

This mod is to make it more mouse-and-keyboard friendly. <br />
(if you already have the tools, why not use them?)

However, it's also not a small task, and gonna take a while. <br />
So I've decided to release it bit-by-bit, as I work on it.

hence, WORK-IN-PROGRSS (WIP) label

Currently available: <br />
- Click Arrows at sides to switch tab/'pane' <br />
- Click Tabs in top right
